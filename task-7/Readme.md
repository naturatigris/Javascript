This project implements a chat interface that mimics real-time messaging behavior without requiring a backend. It's designed for front-end practice and demonstrations using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system simulates a live chat experience by generating fake incoming messages using setTimeout.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Build a responsive chat UI.

Handle and display user input with timestamps.

Simulate incoming messages dynamically using setTimeout or setInterval.

Update the chat window in real-time.

âœ¨ Features
Message Bubbles: Separate visual styles for user and simulated messages.

Timestamps: Every message includes the time it was sent or received.

Dynamic Updates: Chat window auto-scrolls and updates in real-time.

Fake Bot Replies: Bot responses appear after a slight delay to simulate real interaction.

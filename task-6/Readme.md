This project implements a dynamic list that allows users to reorder items using drag and drop functionality. Built using vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Drag and Drop API, it provides intuitive user interaction for rearranging list elements with real-time visual feedback.

âœ¨ Features
Drag & Drop Support: Reorder list items by dragging them into new positions.

HTML5 Drag Events: Utilizes dragstart, dragover, drop, and dragend to handle reordering.

Visual Feedback: Highlights drop targets during drag to improve usability.

DOM Updates: Reflects the new order immediately in the user interface.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Users click and drag a list item.

Potential drop targets are visually highlighted.

When the item is dropped, the list updates to reflect the new order.

The changes are applied directly to the DOM.

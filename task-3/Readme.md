A simple, modern image gallery built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Clicking a thumbnail opens a larger version of the image in a modal/lightbox overlay with smooth transitions.

âœ¨ Features
Responsive grid layout for image thumbnails.

Click thumbnail â†’ open large version in a modal.

Smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions.

Click outside the image or on the close button (Ã—) to dismiss the modal.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Clicking on a thumbnail triggers a modal that displays the full-size image (data-full attribute).

Modal visibility is managed by adding/removing CSS classes (hidden, show) with slight delays for smooth effects.

Modal closes by clicking the close button or clicking outside the image area.

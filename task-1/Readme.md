This project is a basic to-do list application built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can add, complete, and remove tasks with live updates to the list through DOM manipulation.

Features

-Add new tasks dynamically.

-Mark tasks as complete (toggle completion).

-Remove tasks easily.

-Tasks stored in an array (optional: persisted in localStorage).

How It Works

-JavaScript listens for form submissions to create new list items (<li>).

-Clicking on a task toggles its completion style.

-Clicking a delete button removes a task from the list (and optionally from storage).

-localStorage can be used to save tasks between page reloads.

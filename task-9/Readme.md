This project demonstrates how to implement infinite scrolling on a web page using vanilla JavaScript. It dynamically loads more content as the user scrolls near the bottom, enhancing performance and user experience without pagination.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Detect when the user approaches the bottom of the page using the scroll event.

Load more content asynchronously using the Fetch API.

Simulate or use dummy data (JSON API or local file).

Ensure smooth scrolling and DOM updates for optimal performance.

âœ¨ Features
ðŸ§­ Scroll-based content loading

âš¡ Asynchronous data fetching (simulated/dummy or live API)

ðŸ“¦ Dynamic DOM content appending

ðŸ§¹ Efficient scroll detection to prevent redundant calls

ðŸŽ¨ Responsive layout (optional with CSS)
